Water Models for Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Hello!

Welcome to the water model comparison and benchmarking dataset and workflow. Here, we provide the results of all of the water models for molecular dynamics simulations that we've tested so far, as well as the input files needed to run the simulations and perform the analysis yourself. This is very much a work in progress, and will be updated regularly.
